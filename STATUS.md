## Introduction
As of March 11th, 2019 our group has accomplished its goals at this stage in the project. Our goal of creating a minimum viable system has been realized; as we have been able to submit an order (from customer), receive that order (store in database), retrieve that order (extract from database), and display that order to the service side of our application. The most significant part for our team has been the database set-up and service; since none of our members have had any experience prior. We set aside a bulk of time for this, and ended up finishing slightly ahead of schedule. Other accomplishments include integrating multiple languages interacting with each other and having a flow of languages: HTML/CSS -> JavaScript -> JSON -> MongoDB -> AJAX -> JavaScript -> HTML/CSS. We are also using a Python back-end. We have not changed our requirements but have made major changes to design and major events. Contrary to our original design of the system, we will not strictly use MongoDB and have changed our framework to Flask. Flask has allowed us to have a much more stable framework. Our team is still using MongoDB, but only to store data sent by the customer (JavaScript objects converted to a JSON). This is extracted by the kitchen side using Ajax. We chose to use Ajax because it is much easier to integrate with JavaScript and creating the necessary HTML elements, we need to display items/orders. In terms of major events, since we completely switched frameworks (still using Visual Studio Code with Flask) and in doing so our priorities shifted. We had to learn how to make our application more intelligent and integrate multiple moving parts into one synchronized system. Our timeline shifted slightly due to these changes.

## Customer Value
There have been no changes in regard to the value our system offers to the customer. We are still intent on improving our minimum viable system to create a smoother product.
