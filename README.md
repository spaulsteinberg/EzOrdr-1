Ordering System For Mid-Tier Restaurants


We will develop a front end and back end for a new type of ordering system. We will develop this using a combination of HTML/CSS and JavaScript while using a database (perhaps MongoDB) to store it all. This system will allow the customer to order their food from a tablet at their table and send their order directly to the chef or resturant manager. The user will then see the approximate timing of their meal, and the chef will be able to see what food needs to be prepared and by what time. This project would allow resturant owners to cut costs considerably since they would not have a need for nearly as employees while making the same amount of revenue.
